#Pik-App

current stuff I haven't started working on yet:

-graphs, analysis of the data in DB

currently done:

-cleaning up CSV 
-database 
-connecting DB to python 
-main page of GUI 
-GUI is okay now 
-GUI connect to other frames works okay, all in one file though (GUI2.py) since the links weren't working as they should in multiple files. 
-uploading csv files to a folder 'uploads' 
-importing into DB (partially, basics work, Failures yet to be done)

a) run it on 3.10 since it doesn't work with newer Pillow version (py gui.py -version) b) change utils.py --> add PIL.Image.ANTIALIAS = PIL.Image.LANCZOS c) watch the naming and amount of frames you use on Figma
